            <h2 class="title">Types of Video Surveillance Systems</h2>
            <p>Today’s technology for commercial video surveillance systems occupies three categories. Analog, or traditional Closed-Circuit Television, HD-CCTV, also referred to as TVI or CVI and IP Video systems, usually run from an IP network. All of our business CCTV cameras and outdoor cameras that we install in  the Tri-State area can be viewed “live” by closed circuit television. You can also archive recorded video for future review in the event of theft, vandalism, or the need to reenact employee activities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>There are many makes, models, features and price points for video security cameras. Understanding these differences and how the technology best suits your needs and budget will allow you to capture usable live video from both the interior and exterior areas of your business. The signal transmitted from the security camera is displayed “live” on closed circuit television, commonly referred to as CCTV, and footage is saved to a set of files within the security server on a storage device such as a Network Video Server (NVR) or Digital Video Recorder (DVR). All the CCTV cameras we install in the Tri-State area allow you to view archived video through a Video Management Software (VMS) solution to be viewed as needed. Emerging technology using cloud-based video management and archive storage is also becoming more reliable and affordable. SJS’s video surveillance experts in the Tri-State area can outfit your business with any manner of surveillance equipment including indoor or outdoor cameras, video recording devices, motion sensors, wireless security cameras, night vision, video analytics, and more.</p>

            <h3 class="title">HD-CCTV</h3>

            <p>HD-CCTV is a generic term we use to refer to HD Video over coaxial cable. These technologies can deliver 2-8 megapixel camera resolution and recording. The greatest benefit to this technology is to upgrade older systems without having to run new network cables resulting in significant cost savings to enjoy exceptional viewing clarity. The DVR storing video archives can be networked and accessed over the company network, remotely from outside of the network via a PC, tablet, laptop and/or mobile device (Cellphone).</p>

            <h3 class="title">IP Video Systems</h3>

            <p>IP Video Surveillance Systems employ today’s latest technologies allowing for more functionality and control of each IP camera as a smart device on the edge of the network. Bi-directional communication allows ease of communication to the camera to adjust settings, and also expands the camera’s ability to communicate across the network. These systems can be designed to utilize existing network infrastructure, or can be a closed network with a single uplink to view cameras from within the company network. These types of design and engineering decisions are generally considered when meeting with your team and looking at the overall topography of your network, bandwidth requirements, camera locations, etcetera.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Analog or CCTV</h3>

            <p>Yesterday’s technology, analog cameras are surprisingly employed at many existing locations that are still operating with sub 720p resolution cameras and even VHS tapes. Our video surveillance company in the Tri-State area specializes in updating these legacy systems, to get you into a higher functioning and much improved resolution solution at the lowest cost possible.</p>

                <p>In addition to security cameras, a comprehensive security system will also include some kind of access control solution. We can source and install proximity card readers, biometric systems, and combination keypad/card readers. When you think about access control, you probably envision points of entry into buildings, but it can extend to the perimeters of the outdoor property as well. A fully integrated video surveillance system with properly placed security cameras at key entry points where electronic door locks are utilized can be a useful tool when reconciling entry to a door. By integrating advanced locks and video monitoring, you can ensure the highest levels of protection for your facility.

                <button type="button" class="faqBtn" id="faqBtn">What are some of the advantages of commercial video surveillance systems?
                </button>
                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>Commercial video surveillance systems provide extensive benefits to business owners and employees alike. These systems allow you to record and monitor business activities, the behavior of company personnel and visitors, which can act as a useful deterrent for unwanted events such as vandalism or theft. Having a properly designed commercial video surveillance system proves to be an invaluable management tool, allowing your ownership and management team to have their finger on the pulse of the operation. Should an employee accident happen, or an unwanted loss take place, having video footage is an excellent resource to verify the who, what, where, and why of an incident. This will aid in follow-up with the proper authorities, insurance carrier, and to aid in preventing the same incident from occurring again. Remote monitoring of the video surveillance system leads to increased operational efficiency and profits. Utilization of video analytics software can also aid in preventing loss events before they occur.</p>

                <button type="button" class="faqBtn" id="faqBtn">How do you monitor video surveillance?
                </button>
                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>You can monitor your video surveillance system by viewing previously recorded footage or streaming camera feeds live. To view live, you’ll need to have live access to your video surveillance system. Many modern systems allow for digital footage to stream directly to mobile devices such as smartphones, or to other devices like desktops and laptops that have access to the network. In closed circuit TV systems, the footage usually feeds to a central location with screens for security personnel to monitor on-site. Leveraging video analytics, one can also employ text notifications when motion occurs, when someone enters an area that is closed, or if there is an anomaly that requires immediate attention. Employing a voicedown function where you can speak from your monitoring location to the subject(s) at the location is a proven effective way to minimize loss and damage to property.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>Cameras and video management systems are evolving quickly. When deciding on which cameras would best suit the needs of your business, we recommend to first consider your budget, overall needs, and how the system will be used by management. The most up to date option is an IP camera with resolution as high as 4K or 8.0 Megapixel. These newer model cameras provide a crystal-clear picture quality with digital zoom, mobile streaming, night vision, HD recording, video analytics, and more. IP cameras also integrate well with access control systems, which can make your commercial security more effective as a whole.</p>

                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>A commercial security system commonly consists of video surveillance and access control equipment working together to safeguard and monitor your facility, employees, and assets. By utilizing cameras to monitor your facility and card readers to control who can access certain areas, you can effectively monitor, control, and track who is entering while ensuring that your property and those inside it are safe.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>The price of a surveillance system varies greatly depending on the size of the facility, the sophistication of the equipment, the number of cameras or monitors, and more. Upgrading your current analog camera system is a vastly different project than building a brand-new system with the most cutting-edge video surveillance technology. Every system is custom designed to fit the size and needs of each business.  Generally speaking, video surveillance systems run between $500 – $1,500 per camera installed.  Access Control Systems run between $1,100 and $3,000 per door installed.</p>

                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>No, business security cameras are purchased in full and installed by a service. There can be fees for surveillance software licenses per camera, but the hardware and installation fees are generally paid once. In some cases, the security company may offer an extended warranty which includes the regular service of your hardware and software and advanced replacement for any non-functioning components. This service would be extra and justify a recurring fee.</p>

                <button type="button" class="faqBtn" id="faqBtn">What is the difference between CCTV and IP camera?
                </button>
                <div class="faqContent">
                    <p>CCTV is a general term that refers to a closed-circuit television.  These surveillance systems are connected via a closed circuit and are usually hardwired to one another with a coaxial cable. IP cameras are more sophisticated smart devices with their own programming and monitoring features. They have bidirectional communication and can be synced, programmed, and monitored outside of their closed loop. IP cameras offer greater versatility and customization as well as advanced technology to record, view, and stream.</p>
