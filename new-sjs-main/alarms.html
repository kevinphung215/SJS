        WE GO THE EXTRA MILE
        If a fire breaks out in your building, you need to know that your alarm system is going to help everyone get out safely and prevent property damage. This is why the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the State of California maintain strict standards regarding fire alarm systems.
        
        This is also why SoCal Access and Video goes the extra mile to ensure that every fire alarm system we design and work with meets or exceeds the standards of the NFPA, California Administrative Code Title 24, and any additional city-level requirements. We have helped countless customers in Los Angeles, San Gabriel Valley, Orange County, Long Beach, and the South Bay with installation, inspection, and maintenance of their fire alarm systems.
        
        ALARM SYSTEMS
        Immediately Notify the Fire Department
        
        
        When a fire breaks out, every second counts as you evacuate, and you want to know that help is on the way. When you have a modern, state-of-the-art fire alarm system designed by SoCal Access and Video, you can be sure that your fire alarm system will immediately notify the fire department the moment a fire is detected.
        
        Reduce Property Damage
        The sooner you are aware of a fire, the sooner it can be put out, reducing damage to your building and everything inside. This can mean the difference between minimal damage and a complete loss.

        Your fire alarm and your security system are both crucial components protecting your property, and your building can benefit greatly from a seamless installation.
