            <h2 class="title">Types of Video Surveillance Systems</h2>
            <p>Today’s technology for commercial video surveillance systems occupies three categories. Analog, or traditional Closed-Circuit Television, HD-CCTV, also referred to as TVI or CVI and IP Video systems, usually run from an IP network. All of our business CCTV cameras and outdoor cameras that we install in Claremont and Southern California can be viewed “live” by closed circuit television. You can also archive recorded video for future review in the event of theft, vandalism, or the need to reenact employee activities.
            <br>
            There are many makes, models, features and price points for video security cameras. Understanding these differences and how the technology best suits your needs and budget will allow you to capture usable live video from both the interior and exterior areas of your business. The signal transmitted from the security camera is displayed “live” on closed circuit television, commonly referred to as CCTV, and footage is saved to a set of files within the security server on a storage device such as a Network Video Server (NVR) or Digital Video Recorder (DVR). All the CCTV cameras we install in Claremont and Southern California allow you to view archived video through a Video Management Software (VMS) solution to be viewed as needed. Emerging technology using cloud-based video management and archive storage is also becoming more reliable and affordable. SoCal’s video surveillance experts in Claremonte can outfit your business with any manner of surveillance equipment including indoor or outdoor cameras, video recording devices, motion sensors, wireless security cameras, night vision, video analytics, and more.</p>

            <h3 class="title">HD-CCTV</h3>

            <p>HD-CCTV is a generic term we use to refer to HD Video over coaxial cable. These technologies can deliver 2-8 megapixel camera resolution and recording. The greatest benefit to this technology is to upgrade older systems without having to run new network cables resulting in significant cost savings to enjoy exceptional viewing clarity. The DVR storing video archives can be networked and accessed over the company network, remotely from outside of the network via a PC, tablet, laptop and/or mobile device (Cellphone).</p>

            <h3 class="title">IP Video Systems</h3>

            <p>IP Video Surveillance Systems employ today’s latest technologies allowing for more functionality and control of each IP camera as a smart device on the edge of the network. Bi-directional communication allows ease of communication to the camera to adjust settings, and also expands the camera’s ability to communicate across the network. These systems can be designed to utilize existing network infrastructure, or can be a closed network with a single uplink to view cameras from within the company network. These types of design and engineering decisions are generally considered when meeting with your team and looking at the overall topography of your network, bandwidth requirements, camera locations, etcetera.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Analog or CCTV</h3>

            <p>Yesterday’s technology, analog cameras are surprisingly employed at many existing locations that are still operating with sub 720p resolution cameras and even VHS tapes. Our video surveillance company in Claremont specializes in updating these legacy systems, to get you into a higher functioning and much improved resolution solution at the lowest cost possible.</p>

            <h2 class="title">Access Control Integration</h2>
            <p>In addition to security cameras, a comprehensive security system will also include some kind of access control solution. We can source and install proximity card readers, biometric systems, and combination keypad/card readers. When you think about access control, you probably envision points of entry into buildings, but it can extend to the perimeters of the outdoor property as well. A fully integrated video surveillance system with properly placed security cameras at key entry points where electronic door locks are utilized can be a useful tool when reconciling entry to a door. By integrating advanced locks and video monitoring, you can ensure the highest levels of protection for your facility. Learn more about Integration and our Access Control Systems here, or contact us today and one of our professionals will assist you in finding the right solution for your organization. </p>
